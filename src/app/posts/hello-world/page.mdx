# Welcome to My Personal Site

Published on 31st Dec 2024

Hello and welcome! I’ve been wanting to set up a personal website for a while
now, and I’m thrilled to finally share it with everyone. This site will serve
as my personal corner of the internet, where I’ll showcase some of my
experiences, thoughts and ideas on software development and technology.

As a senior software engineer I’ve had the opportunity to solve varied problems
and work with a wide range of tools. I’m excited to share what I’ve learned,
and I hope it will be helpful and inspiring.

This site is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and styled with 
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

With 2025 just around the corner, I want to take a moment to wish everyone a
very happy and prosperous new year!

Feel free to reach out or share your thoughts on any of my posts—I’d love to
hear from you!

Cheers,  
Aishik
